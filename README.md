# Political Compass

Fun little app to determine your political attitude based on German politics.

## Details

You'll be asked a series of questions, where you'll be given 5 different choices to answer. 
Each answer corresponds to a numeric value ranging from 0 to 4. After the last question was answered, a score will be computed.
The lower the score, the more radical (left) your attitude is. Your score will be matched with the German party that fits your score the most.
