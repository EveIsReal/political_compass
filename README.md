# Political Compass

Fun little app to determine your political attitude based on German politics.

## Details

You'll be asked a series of questions, where you'll be given 4 different choices to answer. 
Each answer corresponds to a numeric value ranging from 0 to 3. After the last question was answered, a score will be calculated.
The lower the score, the more left your attitude is. Your score will be matched with the German party that fits your score the most. 
A well known member of that party is randomly chosen as your match.
